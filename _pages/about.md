Hi, welcome to the personal academic homepage of Jianming Zheng! 
I'm a senior year undergraduate student at the [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/phyen/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). I'm doing research roughly on theoretical high energy physics. 
I'm interested in quantum gravity and string theory, especially in the chaotic behacvior of quantum gravity. Currently my research focuses on how random matrix universality is manifested in semiclassical gravity and worldsheet string theory, as well as its implication to quantum information theory. 
During my undergraduate years in Tsinghua, I have been learning about and doing research on the role of wormholes in quantum chaos and many-body teleportation, advised by Zhenbin Yang at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. Currently I'm an undergraduate visiting scholar at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), in collabration with [Prof. Mukund Rangamani](https://mukund.physics.ucdavis.edu/). 
 
 You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/JianmingZhengPhys/jmzphys.github.io/blob/3149697cfc136250b2e463f3e0a1f547671eb5f1/assets/zhengjmCV.pdf).
